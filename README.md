# CaseConverterProgram
List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method.  In this project, you'll write a program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.
